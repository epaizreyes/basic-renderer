# Basic Renderer
This is a lightweight rendering pipeline using OpenGL.

## Requirements

* [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/): used as a low level rendering library.
* [3rd Party Libraries]: external libraries needed in this project.
    * [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw): Creation of windows, contexts and surfaces. It also receives inputs and events.
